AI Healthcare Diagnosis AssistantA project utilizing Artificial Intelligence to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing patient conditions more efficiently and accurately.
Overview: 
This project implements a machine learning model, specifically a AI Healthcare Diagnosis Assistant, trained on vast amounts of anonymized patient data (symptoms, lab results, medical history) to predict potential diagnoses. The assistant acts as a powerful screening and second-opinion tool, aiming to reduce diagnostic errors and speed up the patient care process.
Features:
Intelligent Diagnosis: Predicts the top most likely diseases based on input data.
Symptom Checker: Allows users to input a list of symptoms and instantly receive potential condition matches.
Risk Assessment: Highlights potential high-risk diagnoses and urgent medical flags.
Integration Ready: Designed with a modular API for easy integration into existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems.
Model Explainability: Provides basic insights into the features (symptoms, labs) that most influenced the diagnosis prediction (e.g., using SHAP or LIME).
